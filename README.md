## Streaming project iterative plan
1. simulate stream code python
2. ingest data using kafka
     create different kafka topics (one for heart disease one for sleep etc) 
4. process the data and connect it to BI tool
      it's better to create multi-facade dashboard
6. store the data in cassandra
     create different column families for each topic (probably)
     connect cassandra on datastax cloud
